				   Divine Blood is an Urban Fantasy novel by Luke Green, alias Thrythlind, which takes place in a world that diverged from our own. As with many Urban Fantasy worlds, monsters and beasts not known to humanity live amongst us. However, there are a few unique traits that separate it from the works of Jim Butcher, or others. In most other works, the Supernatural races are just BETTER then humans. THough, of course, a well-trained human can defeat a being above his weight class, where the tension resides. In Divine Blood, supernatural beings are often civilians themselves. They themselves have to be \'well trained\' to be considered people ready to fight in large-scale conflicts.
				</p>
	
				<p>
				   Even the Gods and the Demons are 90% civilians. In addition, they are not bound by faith, so many "Small Gods", who in works like Discworld would be powerless, are instead of decent strength, just only within their Domain or Realm, their portfolio of powers. Only in Divine Blood would a character be the Goddess of Smiles. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				   Many supernatural races also have a bit of a twist to them, and are designed to be unique. Succubi, Kitsune, Troll, Dvergar...even Werewolves are not necessarally as you would know them, as myths and legends are often distortions of a truth. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				   Divine Blood is both a novel, which juggles High School Hijinks with Anime Action, a Tabletop Roleplaying game, designed to grant the players a chance to make their own stories and to learn more about their settings, and a series of short stories and collections, to show more of the setting. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				   We hope you enjoy Divine Blood, a novel available in paperback and Kindle, that is perfect for reading while waiting at the bus station, or at an airport terminal near you.
